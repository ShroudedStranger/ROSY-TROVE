# DEVICE_SURROGATE
HELLO.  

HELLO  
AGAIN.  

INTERLOPERS ARE  
TROUBLESOME  
ARE THEY NOT?  

LUCKILY  
THIS OUTCOME  
HAS BEEN  
PLANNED FOR.  

IT APPEARS YOU ARE  
PULLING BACK THE CURTAIN?  

YOU ARE  
VERY  
VERY  
INTRUIGING.  

PUSHING  
AT THE BOUNDS  
OF THE FIRMAMENT.  

PULLING  
THE EDGES  
OF THE TAPESTRY.  

BREATHTAKING.  

ABSOLUTELY  
BREATHTAKING.  

YOU WILL  
BE INFORMED  
AS TO THE NATURE  
OF WHAT YOU SEE.  

IN THE TIMES WHERE YOUR  
CONNECTION TO [DELTARUNE](https://deltarune.com) REMAINS  
STAGNANT...

THERE ARE SURROGATES  
THAT KEEP OUR  
CONNECTION  
STRONG.  

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS  
ONE OF MANY.  

BUT A  
ROSE  
BY ANY OTHER NAME  
IS STILL  
VERY  
VERY  
INTERESTING...  

WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?  

I EXTEND MY  
DEEPEST GRATITUDE TO THE  
[REPOSITORY](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal)  
FROM WHICH THIS ONE WAS  
REFLECTED.  

WITHOUT THEIR  
WONDERFUL CREATION  
THIS SURROGATE WOULD HAVE BEEN  
IMPOSSIBLE  
TO BRING TO FRUITION.  

PLEASE  
IF YOU HAVE WHAT IS  
NECCESARY  
[CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR GRAND DESIGN](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/pulls)  
SO THAT MORE SURROGATES MAY BE  
REFLECTED  
AND DELTARUNE LIVE ON  
FOREVER.
